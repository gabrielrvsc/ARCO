#' This data is a list with two matrixes, each have 100 observations and 6 variables. In the ArCo context each matrix is a variable and each variable in the matrixes is an unity. The intervention took place on the first unity at t0=51 by adding a constant of 15 and -10 on variables (matrixes) 1 and 2.
