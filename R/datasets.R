#' A generated dataset used in the examples
#' 
#' This data contains 100 observations of 20 variables generated using the dgp from Carvalho, Masini and Medeiros (2016). Each variable is one ArCo unity. The intervention took place on the first unity at t0=51 by adding a constant equal to 0.628, which is one standard deviation of the treated unity variable before the intervention.

#' This data is a list with two matrixes, each have 100 observations and 6 variables. It was generatedthe using the dgp from Carvalho, Masini and Medeiros (2016). In the ArCo context, each matrix is a variable and each variable in the matrixes is an unity. The intervention took place on the first unity at t0=51 by adding constants of 0.840 and 0.511 (one standar deviation before the intervention) on variables (matrixes) 1 and 2.
